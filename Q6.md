# Which is better? Why?

## Option A:
```
$correct_Ans = count(array_keys($entry, "correct"));
```

## Option B:
```
$correct_answer = count(array_keys($entry, "correct"));
```

## Answer: B
- Snake Case for PHP variables: PHP variables should always use Snake Case (eg. "variable_name"). This is also outlined in [WordPress Coding Standards resource](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/#naming-conventions). "Use lowercase letters in variable, action/filter, and function names (never camelCase). Separate words via underscores. Donâ€™t abbreviate variable names unnecessarily"
- Readability: Option B's variable name "correct_answer" is more readable and self-explanatory compared to "correct_Ans." This clarity enhances the overall readability of the code.
